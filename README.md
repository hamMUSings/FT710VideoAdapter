# FT710VideoAdapter
 DVI to HDMI adapter for Yaesu Ham Radios

There are reports of folks with Yaesu FT-710 and FT-DX10 damaging their radios while using the DVI video output to HDMI monitor. One big challenge is knowing what is inside the adaptor itself - ie what goes where and if it is active or passive.  

This small projects goal was to:
- Make an adapter where the paths inside where known
- Design in/out features to in theory mitigate paths of damage

Included are the schematic with explanations/BOM as well as a gerber file for the custom PCBs

DISCLAIMER: This is all based on my own reserach of HDMI protocols, forum post, and some correspondence with Yaesu Tech Support

Yaesu did NOT provide the pinout guide
